    <h2>Recipies-World's best scrambled eggs</h2>
    I adapted this recipe from a book called Sydney Food by Bil Granger. Ever
    since tasting these eggs on my first visit to Bil's restaurant in kings cross,
    sydney, i have been after the recipe. i have since transformed it into
    what i really believe are the best scrambled eggs i have ever tasted. <br>
    This recipe is what i call a 'very special breakfast'. just look at the
    ingredients to see why it has to be tasted to be believed.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    The following ingredients make one serving:
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of butter(10g)</li>
      <li>1/3 cup of cream</li>
      <li>a pinch of salt</li>
      <li>freshly miled black pepper</li>
      <li>3 fresh chives(chopped)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk eggs, cream and salt in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat.</li>
      <li>Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts setting
      around the edge of the pan.</li>
      <li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if
      it were an omlet, and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
      <li>Grind a light sprinkling of freshly miled pepper over the eggs
       and blend in some chopped fresh chives.</li>
    </ol>
    You should only make a <b>maximum</b> of two servings per frying pan.
