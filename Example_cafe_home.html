 <h2>This weekend's special brunch</h2> </p>
 <p>this weekend, our season of special brunches continue with scrambled eggs on
 an english muffin. not for the faint hearted, the secret to these eggs is
 that they are made with half cream and cooked in butter, with no more than
four eggs at a time.</p>
